Summary of our submission
This video is about an AI-powered app called AiFiXiT. The video demonstrates how to use the app to fix a problem with your phone.

In the video, a user gives the app permission to use their camera and GPS. The user then takes a picture of what needs fixing. In this case, the user wants their eyeglass lenses cleaned. The user can then specify what needs to be done in the app, and the app will generate a detailed overview of how to fix the problem. 
The user can also edit the information provided by the app and add any additional notes. Since the user gave the app permission to use their GPS location, the app can also recommend local businesses that can help fix the problem. Once the user is satisfied with the information, they can save it …

The Gemini will provide information on:
* Overview of how to solve the task
* The parts needed and the budget for the task
* Step-by-step instructions. 
* A local business to help with the task.


The video concludes by stating that the creators believe this is the future of how people will get things done with AI.
